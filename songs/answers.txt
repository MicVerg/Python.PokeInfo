If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
to match the average of energy, valence and danceability
(im sorry this question is not very clear to me, maybe my English is too bad)

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
to consider everything, including loudness, speechiness, duration etc
