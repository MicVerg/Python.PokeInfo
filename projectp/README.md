# QUICKLIST
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
The point of this project was to replicate an existing grocery list app I already use on my phone, but to copy and implement it into a desktop GUI.
More specifically, the point of this project was to learn more about OOP. I've been somewhat struggling with the concept so figured this would be good practise.
I will need a lot more practise to be comfortable with OOP though.

Perhaps python wasn't the best language to practise this in, I'm not sure.
The entire gui is constructed using customtkinter, which is a module constructed on top of tkinter, if I understand correctly.

The project is not completely finished and is very rough on the edges. I struggled with a lot of the syntax, positioning and layout of windows in general.

In hindsight, maybe I should have attempted another project, but I learned a lot more about OOP regardless.

In short:
you can make different grocery lists, so you can make a list for different shops
you can add and remove these lists yourself (there's no edit option as of now)
in the list itself, you can add and remove items, and you can check/ uncheck an item you bought, based on your input, an image will be shown (ex. dairy), so you can focus on 1 part of the store at a time
you can use the switch button to mark a list as completed
that's it!

I used phone dimensions, simply because it made sense for me to remake the mobile app I already use like that. (Whilst it do)
This application needs a lot of polishing, it needs editing lists/ items, windows should be shown properly on top of eachother (something I've struggled immensely with and haven't found a proper solution for).
On different screens different elements need more polishing actually, more specifically the positioning and sizing of the different elements.
In hindsight perhaps I should have just tried to make a mobile app from the start, but alas, I figured making a desktop GUI would be more beginner friendly.

The customtkinter buildup kind of speaks for itself, there's not a lot of flexibility in usage, the point will remain to be to make a frame and to add elements to that frame, those elements which you can connect to different commands/ functions to pass variables and get the info you need from 1 place to the other.

I somewhat worked around the CS50 check, since my functions aren't on the same indentation level as main, I don't really understand why that is a requirement.
I also don't know how to test my GUI functions to be completely honest, so I worked around that as well to get the CS50 check done.

I THINK more ideal would have been to practise more OOP with Java or C, but I'm very unsure, OOP is definitely something I'll need more practise for and I do see and understand now why it is implemented commonly, it still feels strange to go from procedural to OOP though.

I also learned quite a bit about moving between codespace and local machine development, since the GUI tester of codespace was down a lot.

At the end of the day, I'm not stoked about the result of this program at all, it's quite ugly and unpolished, but I learned a lot and got more comfortable because of making it.
I will continue to practise on OOP with a different project.
