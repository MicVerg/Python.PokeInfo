# PokeInfo
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/iqGzKAzy9_k>
#### Description: A lightweight PokeDex that shows only the information I used to want to see as a kid growing up ..
Powered by https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
I really wanted to learn how API's work and didn't know anything about them before this little project.
Initially I had other ideas for projects, but I had issues finding access to the API's I needed for those ideas, so the pokeapi was a blessing!

The app is very lightweight using only Python - Flask and making calls to different pokeapi pages, combining those calls to navigate through the pokedex.
