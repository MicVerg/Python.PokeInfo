#### Description: A lightweight PokeDex that shows only the information I used to want to see as a kid growing up ..

I really wanted to learn how API's work and didn't know anything about them before this little project.
Initially I had other ideas for projects, but I had issues finding access to the API's I needed for those ideas, so the pokeapi was a blessing!

The app is very lightweight using only Python - Flask and making calls to different pokeapi pages, combining those calls to navigate through the pokedex.
I didn't pay a lot of attention to design, I really just wanted to focus on how I could get data out of the API and how I could display it properly.
